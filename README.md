Today is still a normal day, but I really took the agency. Before, I asked me to write PS, I wrote it, and I wrote a lot, but I sent it to them on Friday. They told me that there were too many words on Tuesday night, so what did they do these four days? I took it. I had to change the number of words on the back, and I had to do everything myself, What do they do? I just want to ask. It's very slow to get back the news, but if I can finally apply to Sheffield University, I don't say anything before. I'm actually quite like entering Sheffield University, but I don't know if I can afford to live as a graduate student. Now I feel like a year, There are so many things to learn every day. When I get home, I have to keep learning. My body really can't afford it. In fact, the main problem is English. I may enter a foreign enterprise in the future, but I really can't stand the working mode of a small factory. I hope I can enter a large factory when looking for a job in the future, but I really hate recitation and algorithm problems, I really have nothing to say, but the social form of China is like this. You have to know all the codes, concepts and so on before you can have a job. It's even more difficult to want a high paid and decent job. But luckily I was born in Shanghai, otherwise I really don't know what to do.
